Audience level:

#Description

For today's modern web applications it's inevitable
that you're going to need some client side magic
to give your application the responsiveness it needs. 
This talk covers some of the dos and don'ts of 
integrating JavaScript with various Python web 
frameworks like Django.

#Abstract

Having spent the last year working on a big Django 
+ AngularJS web application, Jen has ironed out 
the majority of issues that you might bump into 
whilst trying to work with both Python and JavaScript.

She will go over some of the common pitfalls, 
whilst outlining best practice. This talk will cover 
set up of some of the common combinations of frameworks 
your might be considering using for your next big 
project, and also examine how to leverage API modules 
like Django's Tastypie in order to provide a RESTful 
API and create a good abstraction between your server 
side and client side code.
